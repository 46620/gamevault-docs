# Introduction

> Let's discover Crackpipe!

## What is Crackpipe

Crackpipe is a free, open-source, and decentralized gaming platform, offering an alternative to popular ones like Steam, Epic Games, and others. Unlike traditional platforms where you buy games, Crackpipe allows you and your friends to play and keep track of games stored on a file server.

Think of it as Jellyfin, but for video games. You don't buy games on Crackpipe; instead, you bring your games from wherever you have them, and the platform organizes them for you.

Crackpipe has two main components: a self-hosted NestJS Backend Application and one or more Windows Store App Clients.

It is intended to work with "alternatively obtained" games, like DRM-free games, instead of games from traditional platforms While Crackpipe can be used with cracked games, it does not promote or support piracy.
