# Introduction

> Let's discover Crackpipe!

## What is Crackpipe

Crackpipe is an innovative gaming platform providing a decentralized, open-source alternative to popular gaming platforms like Steam and Epic Games. It allows you and your friends to enjoy playing and organizing games stored **on your own file server**.

But Crackpipe operates differently. You can not buy games on this platform. Instead, think of it as your personal Steam or Jellyfin for video games. You bring your own games from wherever you have them, and the platform detects and provides a user-friendly interface to easily download, install, and track your playtimes and progress. You can not stream games with this app.

The Crackpipe ecosystem consists of two main components: a self-hosted NestJS Backend Application and one or more Windows Store App Clients, ensuring a seamless and efficient gaming experience.

Crackpipe is specifically designed for "alternatively obtained" games, such as DRM-free games, rather than games from conventional platforms. It's important to note that while Crackpipe can be used with cracked games, it does not endorse or support piracy.

In summary, Crackpipe empowers gamers by offering a flexible and convenient way to organize and play their game library from a self-hosted file server.
