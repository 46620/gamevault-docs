# Introduction

> Let's discover Crackpipe!

## What is Crackpipe

Crackpipe is an open-source, decentralized, selfhosted and liberal alternative to Game Platforms and Launchers like Steam, Origin, Epic Games, GoG, etc. which allows you to play and track games that are on a fileserver.

The Crackpipe ecosystem consists of a selfhostable NestJS Backend Application and one or more Windows Store App Clients.

It was designed to work with "alternatively obtained" games such as DRM-free games. While Crackpipe can be used to install cracked games, it does not encourage or condone piracy.
