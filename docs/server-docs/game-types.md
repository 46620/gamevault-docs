# Game Types

GameVault provides various **Types** of Games. The client application will treat different kinds of games in different ways. For example when installing them.

The Game Type is detected by the server automatically, but can be overwritten by using the Type Tag from [GameVaults Naming Structure](structure.md).

A game can only have one type tag. If it has multiple type tags, all type tags will be ignored.

## List of currently supported Game Types

### Direct-Play Games (DP)

Direct-Play games are game files that can be played immediately. No additional setup is necessary.

### Setup-Needed Games (SN)

For Setup-Needed games, users must go through a setup process (e.g. "setup.exe") before playing the game.
